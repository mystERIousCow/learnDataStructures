# learnDataStructures
An interactive website for learning and visualizing classic data structures.  
Includes explanations, complexity tables, reference implementations (C++, Java, Python), and simulators for operations like insert, delete, rotations, and heapify.


I created learnDataStructures as a place to document my own learning and share resources with others exploring this subject. When I first took a Data Structures course in high school, I was constantly overwhelmed and struggled to make sense of the material. But over time, the concepts began to click, and I can confidently say that Data Structures was the most valuable and rewarding class I have taken.

I believe that we understand only as much as we can teach, and by explaining concepts to others, we also strengthen our own knowledge. My goal with this site is to make data structures more approachable through interactive simulations and clear explanations.

Thank you for visiting. Whether you are using this as a textbook, reference, or a last-minute study guide, I hope you found this resource useful.
